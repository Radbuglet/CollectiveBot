 *  A template for a handler's implementation. Please see _spec.md for a more detailed explanation of handlers.
 *  Notes:
 *  - export is commented out to avoid polluting intellisense. Real handlers would export their function.
 *  - This file begins with an underscore to put it at the top of the file list. Please don't do that for real handlers.
 *  - Please delete this giant comment block before coding.
